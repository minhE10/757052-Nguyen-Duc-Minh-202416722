- Question: Is JAVA a Pass by Value or a Pass by Reference programming language? 

Java is a pass by Value language. when a method is passed a primitive-data-type parameter, it create an copy the variable with the same value and do operations on it. When a method is passed a non-primitive one, it copy the direction of the variable in the memory

●After the call of swap(jungleDVD, cinderellaDVD) why does the title of these two objects still remain?

as the swap function swap 2 copy of int variable, so it just swap 2 copy, not 2 original ones

●After the call of changeTitle(jungleDVD, cinderellaDVD.getTitle()) why is the title of the JungleDVD changed?

as this method receive non-primitive parameters, it create 2 copy of 2 variables with the same direction, and they exchange values by swap it directly in the object, so they changed
