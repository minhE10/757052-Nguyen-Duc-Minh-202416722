- If you create a constructor method to build a DVD by title then create a constructor method to build a DVD by category. Does JAVA allow you to do this ?

Answer : JAVA does not allow us to do this. Since both classes are identified by a String parameter, JAVA cannot differentiate these 2 classes with a String. We can do constructor overloading by use different types or numbers of parameters. For example: DigitalVideoDisc(String title, String category); DigitalVideoDisc(String title).
